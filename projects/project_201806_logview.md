The goal if this project was to bring together log data of our high-level task-/state-machine with the continuosly logged data of the sensors of our mobile manipulation robot [AIMM](https://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-11409/#gallery/29194). The results were presented at the Automatica Fair 2018.

### Responsibilities
- setting up and automating the continuous logging of all involved data streams on the robotic platform
- data pre-processing pipeline into suitable formats for querying/analysis
- interactive web viewer for displaying data streams for selected actions
